# Stock Price Analysis Using Webscraping

Objective
This project demonstrates how to extract stock price data and company revenue data using APIs and web scraping, and how to visualize the information using interactive plots. 
The analysis focuses on Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME), comparing historical stock performance with quarterly revenue.

Actions Performed
  1. Extract long-term stock price data using yfinance for TSLA and GME
  2. Scrape quarterly revenue data from HTML tables using BeautifulSoup
  3. Clean, prepare, and merge financial datasets
  4. Visualize stock prices and revenue trends using a custom graphing function
  5. Build an interactive two-panel dashboard for each company

Key Insights
  TESLA (TSLA)
  1. Long-term stock price shows strong exponential growth.
  2. Quarterly revenue increases significantly over time, reflecting business expansion.
  3. Revenue and stock price follow a clear upward trend.
     
  GAMESTOP (GME)
  1. Long history of relatively stable pricing before the 2021 short-squeeze surge.
  2. Revenue peaked around 2015 and gradually declined afterward.
  3. Stock price spike is not correlated with revenue changes — highlighting market volatility unrelated to fundamentals.

Conclusion
The dashboards provide a clear comparison between stock price movement and business revenue — a valuable tool for investors and analysts.
